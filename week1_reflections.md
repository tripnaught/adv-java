This week, we learned about data structures.
I learned that data structures are ways that humans can interact with information. There are different types of data structures, each with their own ups and downs.
1. Record
2. Array
3. Linked list
4. Binary Tree
5. Hash table
6. Heap
7. Graph
Last semester, we learned about arrays and linked lists, and the advantages/limitations of both. I'm excited to learn about these other types of data structures as well.
