# adv-java
A repository to document my Java learning journey!

## About Me
Hi! I'm taking a Data Structures in Java course at my community college. This repo will store my progress and projects for the class. My apologies for all the terrible code contained within. @ngozzle is my alternate account, so some commits might accidently come from there instead.

## Goals for This Course
- Learn about computer-science-ish topics like data structures, abstract data types, and searching algorithms
- Get more familiar with GitHub, and other industry-standard programming tools.
- Pass the class
- Try to keep sentences capitalized (impossible)

## In-Class Java Coding Warm-Up File
TBD
